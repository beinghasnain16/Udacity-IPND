			<p class="description">
				Jaguars are large cats that can be found in North, Central and South America.
				They are identified by their yellow or orange coats, dark spots and short legs.
				Jaguar has the strongest jaw structure of any feline. Although jaguars look very
				much like leopards and are closely related to them, their ecological role and 
				behaviour is more similar to that of the tiger.
